# San Jose Mercury News - [Debora Peterson](http://twitter.com/#!/deborapeterson)  w/ Angela
  * Occupy Oakland Landing Page
  * Tumblr to display photos (mock page on actual site)
  * Google+ (works more business audience)
  * Didn't tweet [Whole Foods Dilemma](http://www.ktvu.com/news/news/local/protesters-target-downtown-oakland-bank-branches/nFTCW/) until they could get a quote from the company.
  * Responsibility of news org to reflect on story after reporting in realtime/using social media

# Mother Jones - [Tasneem Raja](http://twitter.com/#!/tasneemraja)
  * Storify in the newsroom
  * "A (realtime) notebook for reporters" - available for everybody
  * Problem w Occupy Wall Street
    * no central body
    * no central figure head
  * "Storify helps you do journalism asynchronously"
    do a lot at once
  * "It's hard for us to know when a Storify is over"
    * tried to create structure with datelines, etc.
  * Reporter told serialized stories on Twitter — mini narratives
  * Minute-to-minute reporting is valuable, but not sustainable (on most budgets) — reporting is now changing to analysis and context. 

# Oakland Tribune - [Angela Woodhall](http://twitter.com/#!/angelawoodall)
  * How social media/storify to tell stories
    * Storify address complaint: occupiers feel sensationalized — thus storify has them in their own words
    * "If it doesn't go in print, it doesn't go in Storify"
    * Print doesn't give the immediacy that storify/social media do.
    * Occupiers held press conference; tend not to like TV news cameras
    
# East Bay Express - [Ellen Cushing](http://twitter.com/#!/elcush)
  * Alt weekly, not well equip to cover breaking news — Storify makes that possible
  * Different perspectives from one account = confusion, thus reporters text tweets to editors
  * Tell reporters to tweet only what they see, not just word of mouth
  * Keep your audience in mind — report coverage that your niche can understand.
  
# Oakland Local — [Susan Mernit](http://twitter.com/#!/susanmernit)
  * Community voices (curated content) and professional reporters
  * 20 percent increase in traffic because of national interest
  * running pieces from people IN the movement (community voice)
  * Storify/ScribbleLive put up viewpoints we don't endorse (attribution to users)
  * 11 percent of audience 
    * Google Analytics doesn't track WAP (featurephone) browsers?!
  * Journos becoming amplifiers for citizens — sources become reporters
    * People understand they are documentarians. And news orgs may want to cite them.
  * Oakland Local had viral (high traffic) story on OccupyOakland even after SFChronicle and Oakland Tribune published stories first. Readership trusted their voice. 

# HuffPoSF - [Carly Schwatz](http://twitter.com/#!/carlicita)
  * Live blog -> Tweets -> Live blog (create a cycle)
  * Main page on site
  * "Submit Your Own" user-generated content added to major news stories (slideshows primarily)
  * Not Storify users (yet)
  * Reports back to DC (according to @magicandrew)
  
# KQED - [Ian Hill](http://twitter.com/#!/ianhillmedia)
  * News organizations often have disconnect from using social media
  * Approached OccupyOakland using primarily Storify
    * User-generated content
  * Subscribes to OccupyOakland SMS for news info
  * Add specific Twitter feeds to ScribbleLive feed (Merc, MotherJones, etc.)
  * Tackable for user-generated photos (300 photos!)
  * There's no news cycle (implies beginning and end)
