# Oakland Tribune - [Angela Woodhall](http://twitter.com/#!/angelawoodall)
  * How social media/storify to tell stories
    * Storify address complaint: occupiers feel sensationalized — thus storify has them in their own words
    * "If it doesn't go in print, it doesn't go in Storify"
    * Print doesn't give the immediacy that storify/social media do.
    * Occupiers held press conference; tend not to like TV news cameras
    
# East Bay Express - [Ellen Cushing](http://twitter.com/#!/elcush)
  * Alt weekly, not well equip to cover breaking news — Storify makes that possible
  * Different perspectives from one account = confusion, thus reporters text tweets to editors
  * Tell reporters to tweet only what they see, not just word of mouth
